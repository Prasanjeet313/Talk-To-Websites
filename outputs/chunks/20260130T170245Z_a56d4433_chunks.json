    "content": "We try to always be bold, provocative, inquisitive, accessible and inclusive. We tend to avoid negative protesting, victimising, and naming and shaming. We do not target specific individual companies because we believe that the industry’s problems are bigger than any one company’s actions.\nWe very rarely, if ever, encourage boycotting simply because we don’t see it as the most effective way to achieve systemic change. We have heard first-hand from supply chain workers that boycotting can do them more harm than help. In many countries the textile and garment industry is of the few avenues to financial independence for women. They want good jobs and dignity. What they don’t want is a poverty level pay, excessive working hours and unsafe workplaces. This isn’t to say that boycotting never works; it can be used to great effect under the right circumstances and very strategically.\nABOUT FASHION REVOLUTION WEEK\nFashion Revolution Week",
