Frequently Asked Questions
What is a credit card?
A credit card is a financial tool issued by banks that allows you to borrow money up to a predetermined limit to make purchases or withdraw cash. The borrowed amount must be repaid by the due date, either in full or through instalments, with interest applicable on outstanding balances. Credit cards also offer various benefits such as rewards, cashback, and travel perks.
What is a cashback credit card?
A cashback credit card rewards you with a percentage of your spending in the form of cash rebates. For example, if a card offers 5% cashback on groceries, you receive AED 5 back for every AED 100 spent. Cashback cards in the UAE often have specific categories like fuel, dining, or online shopping where higher cashback rates apply.
What is balance transfer in a credit card?

If you pay the full amount before the due date, no interest is charged. However, if you carry forward a balance, interest will apply. Credit cards in the UAE also offer features like installment plans, reward points, and international spending capabilities.
